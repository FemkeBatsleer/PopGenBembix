Aim of this document: provide details on how Geneclass2 was run for the analyses of the main manuscript
by: Femke Batsleer

Geneclass2 can be downloaded from: http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/URLB/GeneClass2/Help/

Following data was loaded:
'reference populations': ..\data\genepop\selectionsamples_oldpop.txt
'samples to be assigned': ..\data\genepop\selectionsamples_all.txt
If an error is accounted when loading: change in the datafiles the kommas separating the loci-names with enter keys (so they are listed under eachother

1) Computation goal: 'Assign/Exclude population as origin of individuals'
2) Criteria for Computation: 'Bayesian methods > Rannala & Mountain'
3) Probability computation: 'Enable probability computation (Monte-Carlo resampling)'
 > 'Rannala & Mountain (1997)'
 > 'Number of simulated individuals: 10000'
 
After calculation, the data was exported to 'Results_indassign_newpopsoldpops_RM_probRM10000MC.csv'
This file was manually slightly adjusted to more easily load into R: 'Results_indassign_newpopsoldpops_RM_probRM10000MC_forR.csv'
In the R-script 'tables_from_output_Geneclass.R', summary tables are made from this output and data created to load into QGIS
QGIS flow chart visualisation was inspired by https://anitagraser.com/2019/05/04/flow-maps-in-qgis-no-plugins-needed/
